# ASP.NET Core Test Project
This repository contains a project created for educational purposes, aiming to explore various features of ASP.NET Core, a framework for building web applications and services. The project includes the following components and features:

- **MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern**: It uses the MVC architectural pattern to organize the codebase into separate components for models, views, and controllers, enhancing maintainability.

- **Clean Architecture**: The project adheres to Clean Architecture principles, emphasizing the separation of concerns and modular design.

- **SOLID Principles**: It follows SOLID principles, which are a set of design principles for writing maintainable and scalable code.

- **Unit Tests and Integration Tests**: The project incorporates both unit tests (testing individual parts of the code) and integration tests (testing interactions between components) to ensure the application functions correctly.

- **Entity Framework Code First**: It employs Entity Framework in a code-first approach, allowing the definition of data models in code and generating the database schema from these definitions.

- **Entities: Person and Country**: The project includes two main data entities, "Person" and "Country," which can be managed through CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

- **User Authentication and Authorization**: It offers user registration, login functionality, and role-based authorization, enabling different levels of access for authenticated users.

- **Exporting to PDF and Excel**: The application provides the ability to generate PDF and Excel files from data, allowing users to export and share information in these formats.

This project serves as a practical exploration of these concepts and features within the context of ASP.NET Core.
